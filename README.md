# Golden Experience

GE is a C/C++ native graphics rendering application that does not use any graphics APIs since im hard like that

## Installation

download the zip [code](https://github.com/MaticFijavz/Golden-experience/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) 

## Current usage
currently only outputs a .ppm image file to a seperate folder called output and indexes them  in order if you like that, dunno.
Outputs a background and a sphere whose color is it surface normals. P hard

## MSAA anti-jaggies (note that these are renders using the normals not the diffuse color)

Current anti aliasing resolution (50 samples)
## Why

tryna impress Resi

## Roadmap
The current roadmap as of editing:\
[x] Output an image \
[x] make a vector (vec3.h) class\
[x] make a colors (colors.h) class\
[x] make a rays (rays.h) class\
[x] A simple camera\
[x] A background\
[x] Adding a Sphere\
[x] Surface Normals and Multiple Objects\
[x] Moving Camera Code Into Its Own Class\
[x] Antialiasing\
[x] Diffuse materials\
[x] Gamma correction\
[ ] Dielectric materials\
[ ] Positionable Camera\
[ ] Defocus Blur
